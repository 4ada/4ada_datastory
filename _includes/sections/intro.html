            <h2>COVID-19 is one of the biggest events in the 21st century and it will go on forever in the annals of history. This virus has transformed our habits, as well as how we interact with others and perceive the outside world. We are aware that each country handled the issue differently and responded with varying weights and measures: some governments, who were more concerned about the virus, imposed early mobility restrictions; other governments, who were less concerned, simply began issuing public warnings without taking further action. Particularly at the start of 2020, each decision had a significant impact on how COVID-19 spread and how many people became infected. Consequently, the following is the major question we are attempting to address in this study: </h2>

            <h2>Therefore, the true idea is to see whether attention towards covid was an essential <span style="font-weight: 550;">tool</span> to fight covid or it was a natural <span style="font-weight: 550;">reaction</span> people had when realizing that covid was a dangerous threat.</h2>
        <h2>To find answers on our questions, we use datasets containing mobility and Wikipedia data, as well tweets posted by common and influential people at the beginning of the pandemic in each one of the following countries: France, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Serbia, Finland, Republic of Korea, Canada, and Japan. Differently from Wikipedia, mainly consulted for educational purposes, Twitter is a more dynamic platform, offering the people the possibility to interact and express opinions as soon as they want. All these qualities make it a perfect tool to extract insight about  peopleâ€™s beliefs, thus inferring the situation going on in a country. Since we are focusing on the early stage of the pandemic,  data used for each country refers to the 3 weeks preceding the official date of the lockdown (or mobility restrictions) in that country.
